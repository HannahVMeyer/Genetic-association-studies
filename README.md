# Genetic association studies: Pipelines and useful functions

The following repository contains pipelines and functions I found useful while
working on genome-wide association studies. This work includes genotype quality
control, phasing and imputation, genome-wide association studies and analysis
thereof.

All scripts can simply be sourced to access the relevant functions. Alternatively,
the [modules package](https://github.com/klmr/modules) offers flexible and tidy
integration of R source files. Application of functions in this repository via modules in e.g.
[ukbb-fd](https://github.com/HannahVMeyer/ukbb-fd/blob/master/association/association_results.r).


## 1. GWAS
Functions for processing and depicting of genome-wide association analysis
results.
## 2. utils
General useful functions for plotting and data processing.
## 3. Genotyping quality control
 
 Coming soon...

## 4. Imputation and phasing
  
  Coming soon...
