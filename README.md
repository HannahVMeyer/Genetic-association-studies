# Genetic association studies: Pipelines and useful functions

The following repository contains pipelines and functions I found useful while
working on genome-wide association studies. This work includes genotype quality
control, phasing and imputation, genome-wide association studies and analysis
thereof.

## 1. GWAS
Functions for processing and depicting of genome-wide association analysis
results, find them [here]()

## 2. reference
Shell scripts for downloading and processing of reference data sets used in
human genetic association studies.
    1. [1000Genomes]()
## 3. utils
Generally useful functions for plotting and data processing, find them [here]().

## 4. Genotyping quality control

 Coming soon...

## 4. Imputation and phasing

  Coming soon...
